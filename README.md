## Overview
Our company has been executing a series of dynamic marketing campaigns across popular social media channels; Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest to promote our products. We have gathered comprehensive daily data for 2023 capturing essential performance metrics such as impressions, clicks, ad spend, conversions, and engagements (including likes, shares, and comments). This project is designed to transform that rich dataset into actionable insights, driving more effective ad spend allocation and refining future marketing strategies.

Executive leadership, marketing directors, and financial controllers require a comprehensive analysis of our multi-channel campaigns. 
This analysis will evaluate key performance metrics—impressions, clicks, conversions, CPC, CTR, and ROI—to identify our top-performing campaigns and platforms. Additionally, it will consolidate insights on geographical engagement, device performance, and ad-level effectiveness, as well as reveal any spend-to-conversion correlations and time-based trends. The goal is to provide clear, actionable recommendations that support strategic decision-making across all levels of the organization, from high-level executive planning to tactical marketing optimization.
