## Overview
Our company has been executing a series of dynamic marketing campaigns across popular social media channels; Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest to promote our products. We have gathered comprehensive daily data for 2023 capturing essential performance metrics such as impressions, clicks, ad spend, conversions, and engagements (including likes, shares, and comments). This project is designed to transform that rich dataset into actionable insights, driving more effective ad spend allocation and refining future marketing strategies.



## <a name="problem-statement"></a>Problem Statement
Executive leadership, marketing directors, and financial controllers require a comprehensive analysis of our multi-channel campaigns. 
This analysis will evaluate key performance metrics—impressions, clicks, conversions, CPC, CTR, and ROI—to identify our top-performing campaigns and platforms. Additionally, it will consolidate insights on geographical engagement, device performance, and ad-level effectiveness, as well as reveal any spend-to-conversion correlations and time-based trends. The goal is to provide clear, actionable recommendations that support strategic decision-making across all levels of the organization, from high-level executive planning to tactical marketing optimization.








## <a name="tools-and-methodology"></a>Tools and Methodology
- ## Tools
  -  MS Powerpoint: I developed the initial wireframe and visual layout for the dashboard to guide design and functionality decisions.

  -  Power Query: I imported the complete dataset, including all columns, into a single table. I transformed the raw dataset into a star schema by splitting it into multiple related tables, which improved performance and manageability. I performed key data transformations, such as joining tables and executing necessary calculations.
    
  -  PowerBI: I utilized DAX formulas to calculate essential performance measures like CPC, CTR, and ROI. I created interactive charts and visualizations to represent the analytical findings. I integrated all visuals and metrics into a cohesive, interactive dashboard.

- ## Methodology
  -  Data Preparation: I loaded the complete dataset into Power Query, ensuring all columns were available for analysis. I restructured the dataset into a star schema by breaking the main table into a central fact table and related dimension tables. I established clear relationships between these tables to optimize query performance and maintain data integrity.

  -  Data Cleaning & Transformation: I identified inconsistencies in the date formats and corrected these by splitting and merging date columns to create a uniform format. I conducted thorough data validation, cross-checking data points and calculated metrics against expected business outcomes. I addressed any anomalies or missing values to ensure the dataset was reliable for further analysis. I executed preliminary calculations during the data preparation phase, ensuring computed fields were correctly reflected across the star schema.

  -  Calculation & Analysis: I leveraged DAX to compute advanced metrics, such as CPC, CTR, and ROI. I created both calculated columns and measures to enable dynamic and interactive data analysis. I continuously validated the computed metrics to ensure accuracy and consistency across all visualizations.

  -  Visualization & Reporting: I designed a 3 page interactive dashboard layout in PowerBI to provide an intuitive user interface for stakeholders.
